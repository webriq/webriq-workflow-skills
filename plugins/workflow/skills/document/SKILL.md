# /document - Documentation Agent

## Workflow

```
/document {ID}
       ↓
1. Resolve task ID → find task document
2. Read task document + test report (pipeline audit)
3. Run git diff — identify pipeline gaps
4. Create/update feature doc (docs/features/{feature}.md)
5. Create/update user guide if user-facing (docs/guides/{feature}.md)
6. Update CLAUDE.md if structural changes detected
7. Write retrospective → update LEARNINGS.md
8. Move task to "Approved" in TASKS.md
       ↓
┌─── Automation Mode? ───┐
│                        │
▼ Manual                 ▼ Auto
Notify user              Output SIGNAL, exit
Ready for /ship
```

---

## Auto Mode Behavior

When task document has `Automation: auto`:

```
≡ SIGNAL
STAGE: document
STATUS: DONE
TASK: {ID}
SUMMARY: Feature doc created
REFERENCE: docs/features/{feature}.md
≡ END
```

**Manual mode:** Run `/clear` then `/ship {ID}`.

## Step 1: Pre-Documentation Checklist — Full Pipeline Audit

#### Step 1A: Read primary sources
```
docs/task/{ID}-{task-name}.md        - What was planned + Implementation Notes from /simplify
docs/testing/{ID}-{task-name}.md     - Test results, failures, retry cycles
```

#### Step 1B: Get the actual file diff
```bash
git diff --name-only main...HEAD
```
Cross-reference against task doc's `## File Changes`. Anything in diff but NOT in the task doc was added by `/simplify` or a `/test` retry — these are pipeline gaps to capture.

#### Step 1C: Classify pipeline gaps

| File in diff but not in task doc | Likely source | Action |
|----------------------------------|---------------|--------|
| Same file, significantly refactored | `/simplify` quality fixes | Note pattern changes in CLAUDE.md if new convention emerged |
| New helper/utility extracted | `/simplify` single-responsibility fix | Add to CLAUDE.md Important File Locations if reusable |
| New test fixture or seed file | `/test` setup | Note in LEARNINGS.md if it reveals a testing pattern |
| Additional files changed in retry | `/test` → `/implement` re-run | Document deviation; check if CLAUDE.md needs updating |
| Migration file added mid-cycle | Any step | Always add to CLAUDE.md — migrations are critical context |

Do NOT do broad codebase exploration. Only open files in the gap list or explicitly needed to verify accuracy.

#### Step 1D: Read /simplify's Implementation Notes

In the task doc `## Implementation Notes`:
- "What was built" — may differ from original plan
- "Deviations from plan" — medium or major deviations surface in documentation
- "Standards check" — fixes may have introduced new patterns worth recording in CLAUDE.md

#### Step 1E: Check /test retry count

In `docs/testing/{ID}-{task-name}.md`:
- 0 retries → note what worked well in LEARNINGS.md
- 1+ retries → root cause of failure is a lesson; always capture in LEARNINGS.md
- Multiple retries on same issue → add "Do Not" entry to CLAUDE.md

## Step 2: Identify Documentation Needs

| Change Type | Documentation Needed |
|-------------|---------------------|
| New feature | Feature doc + User guide |
| Enhancement | Update existing docs |
| Bug fix | Update troubleshooting sections |
| API change | Update API reference |
| Pipeline gap (simplify/test added files) | CLAUDE.md + LEARNINGS.md |

---

## Step 3: Documentation Output

**Feature doc:** `docs/features/{FEATURE}.md` — technical implementation details for developers. Include overview, user journey, architecture (file structure, schema, API endpoints), key components, technical notes.

**User guide:** `docs/guides/{feature}.md` — how to use the feature for end users. Include quick start, step-by-step instructions, tips, FAQ, troubleshooting.

---

## Step 4: CLAUDE.md — Living Project Brain

Read → prune → update (in that order). Never just append.

**Bar for an entry:** A future agent would make a mistake without it, waste time discovering it, or re-open a decision already made.

**Triggers for update after this task:**

| What happened | What to update |
|---------------|----------------|
| New directory created | Project Structure |
| File moved or renamed | Important File Locations |
| Database migration ran | Stack section, schema notes |
| New package installed | Stack section |
| /simplify caught a repeated violation | Do Not |
| Architecture debate resolved | Architecture Decisions |
| Convention violated and then fixed | Key Conventions |
| Old pattern replaced | Remove old entry, add new |

**Skip entirely if:** pure logic fix, copy change, or styling tweak with no new files, directories, migrations, routes, or packages.

**Never skip if:** migration added, new directory created, file moved/renamed, new API route, new env variable required, or pattern replaced.

`/implement` should have already captured these — verify and fill any gaps.

---

## Step 5: Retrospective & LEARNINGS.md

**Task retrospective:** `docs/learnings/{ID}-{task-name}.md`

Covers the entire pipeline — plan vs reality, quality gate findings, test failures, decisions made. Include:
- Plan vs Reality (what was planned, what was committed, deviations, files outside plan)
- What /simplify caught (patterns flagged and fixed)
- What /test revealed (failures and root causes)
- Key lessons (specific and actionable)

**LEARNINGS.md** (project root): Extract the most reusable insight and append to the relevant section.

| Where the lesson came from | LEARNINGS.md section |
|----------------------------|----------------------|
| `/simplify` caught a coding pattern violation | Common Mistakes to Avoid |
| `/simplify` extracted a reusable helper | Established Coding Patterns |
| `/test` failed due to system behavior not in plan | Tech Stack Notes |
| `/test` retry revealed an integration gap | Common Mistakes to Avoid |
| Files in diff not in plan | Tech Stack Notes or Established Coding Patterns |
| Architecture decision made during pipeline | Architecture & Decisions |

**Rules for LEARNINGS.md entries:**
- One entry = one actionable lesson
- Credit the pipeline step that caught it
- Bold the key phrase, explain in one sentence
- Never duplicate — check before appending
- If LEARNINGS.md missing, create with sections: Architecture & Decisions, Established Coding Patterns, Common Mistakes to Avoid, Testing Patterns, Tech Stack Notes

## Documentation Checklist

- [ ] `git diff --name-only main...HEAD` run — full file list captured
- [ ] Pipeline gaps identified and classified
- [ ] `/simplify` Implementation Notes read — deviations noted
- [ ] `/test` retry count checked — root cause of failures identified
- [ ] Feature doc created/updated with accurate file paths
- [ ] User guide created/updated (if user-facing)
- [ ] CLAUDE.md read → pruned → updated (or skipped if no structural changes)
- [ ] `docs/learnings/{ID}-{task-name}.md` written
- [ ] Key lesson(s) appended to `LEARNINGS.md`
- [ ] No duplicate entries in LEARNINGS.md
- [ ] Task moved to "Approved" in TASKS.md

---

## Update TASKS.md

Move task to "Approved":

| ID | Task | Task Doc | Feature Doc | Test Report | Approved |
|----|------|----------|-------------|-------------|----------|

---

## Handoff to /ship

**Manual mode:** Output summary of updated files, task moved to "Approved", next step `/ship {ID}`.
**Auto mode:** Output SIGNAL and exit. The orchestrator handles routing. Do not spawn the next skill.
